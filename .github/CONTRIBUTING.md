# Introduction

### Welcome!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to FHeD!

### Project philosophy

We wanted to create a simple, easy to use, free helpdesk system without all of the extra bells and whistles that some individuals and small companies may not require.

### Roadmap

If you want to know more about the project direction or looking for something to work on, checkout the [roadmap](https://github.com/luketainton/FHeD#Roadmap)!
Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions.

# Ground Rules

### Code of conduct and guidelines

First of all, we expect everyone (contributors and maintainers alike) to respect the [Code of conduct](https://github.com/luketainton/FHeD/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is not a recommendation, it is mandatory.

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: `.gitignore`).
* Do not add unnecessary dependencies.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.

# Getting started

### Discuss about ideas

If you want to add a feature, it's often best to talk about it before starting working on it and submitting a pull request. It's not mandatory at all, but
feel free to open an issue to present your idea.

### How to submit a contribution

The general process to submit a contribution is as follow:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Make you changes in a new branch in your fork (not main)
3. Make sure to fill the [pull request](https://github.com/luketainton/FHeD/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md) properly.

### Happy coding :metal:
